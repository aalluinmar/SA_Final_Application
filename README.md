# SA_Final_Application

> Estimation of Work

- We predicted that meeting the criteria and making the observer functionality more general would take 15-20 hours.

> Requirements

- The main requirements for our project are to implement a fake FlexLM system that will read the text file of licenses available, implementing a licensing library that rests on top of Flex LM Libraries. Requirements include cloud apps and desktop apps. In cloud apps, we require some type of credentials to use JSON API. We need a licensing toolkit that should be implemented on our own as a desktop app. We use Flexera called FLEXLM as a toolkit that must be paid. The team has to set up the local license file or license server on the network. The license file contains a list of entitlements which is validated when read by the license server. The hard part is to divide up the code so that the portions can only be accessed under the license features which we want. These are the main requirements to be considered for the project.
